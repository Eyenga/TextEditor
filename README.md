# Text Editor


---------------------------------------------------------[ DESCRIPTION ]--

This is a text editor application coded in Java. The editor contains 
various features such as spell check, word completion, and readability 
score(i.e Flesch number). Rigth now, it only supports the english language.
I may add other lauguages in the future, if I decide to keep working on it.

Provided is the implementation of the application along with some testing 
files, including a runnable JavaFX program to test and demonstrate the 
implementation.
